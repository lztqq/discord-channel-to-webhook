# discord-channel-to-webhook
A bot that mirrors discord channel to another with a webhook

To launch the bot you have to create a `.env` file in the same folder as app.js and put in some variables, that are:
```
token
channelID
webhookURL
```
All of them should be string values.

After that, install dependencies with
```
npm i
```

And you are ready to launch any time with
```
node .
```
